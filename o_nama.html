                <h2>What's our page about</h2>
                <p>This page gathers all important information and latest news about Formula One. Page was inspired by my passion for the greatest motorsport organisation in the world. This page was made as a project for the class "Basics of HTML & CSS" and it includes: top three teams with their drivers, important informations & race statistics. 
                    Formula One is the pinnacle of motorsports. Its the most technically advanced sport in the world. F1 is single seat, open wheel, open cockpit racing conducted under FIA rules(FORMULA) and is the top tier of open wheel racing(ONE).
                    
                    The present gen F1 cars uses 1.6L turbo charged V6 engine with multiple recovery systems. They create around 900 bhp and Recovery systems provide (129KW) 160 bhp per lap. The cars are limited to 15,000 RPM and uses fuel which is a mixture of 5.75% Alcohol and Unleaded Gasoline. They are monsters when it comes to acceleration capable of going from 0 to 160 km/h (100 mph) and back to 0 in less than five seconds. The 2016 Mercedes w07 can reach 0–300kmph in just 8.4 seconds.
                    
                    Formula 1 is not just a sport, it is way more than that. It pushes mechanical engineering to its peaks. All the best inventions in modern day cars like disk brakes, carbon fiber body, KERS, MGU H,K systems, Carbon ceramic brakes are all invented in F1 for gaining a millisecond advantage. It pushes manufacturing, logistics, Material engineering, Electronics, Communication departments to its max.
                    
                    Leaving all the technical stuff aside, its super fun. Its packed with adrenaline. Whether its brutal overtake at Eau Rouge or simple DRS overtake on Monza pit straight, its extremely pleasing.</p>

                <h2>Interesting facts about Formula One</h2>
                <p>Approximately 80, 000 components come together to make a F1 car, and the cars need to be assembled with 100 % accuracy to work.
                    An average F1 driver loses about 4 kg of weight after just one race. A person who has lost 4% of body weight can lose up to 40% of their psycho-physical ability. The F1 cockpits have drinking bottle installed for the drivers.
                    During the race the tires lose weight too! Each tire loses about 0.5 kg in weight due to wear. Normal tires last 60 000 – 100 000 km. Racing tires are designed to last 90 – 120 km. At top speed, F1 tires rotate 50 times a second.
                    The weight of F1 car is just 820 kg including the driver and full fuel.
                    F1 brake discs are made from a special, indestructible form of carbon fiber. The discs heat up to around 1,200 degrees C – typically the average temperature of molten lava.
                    F1 car engines last only few hours of racing mostly before blowing up. While we expect our engines to last for a decent 20 years on average. That’s the extent to which the engines are pushed to perform. An F1 engine usually revs up to 18000 rpm. The average car revs up to 6, 000 rpm.
                    Small planes can take off at slower speeds than F1 cars travel on the track. However, an amazing aerodynamic downforce provided by their wings keeps them on the track. F1 cars race at speeds of up to 360 kph.
                    F1 drivers experience up to 5G under braking and cornering. That’s a force of load five times a driver’s own bodyweight.
                    The safety of modern F1 cars means drivers can withstand huge crash impacts. The biggest crash impact on record was suffered by David Purley at the British Grand Prix in 1977, where he had an impact that was estimated as 197.8g – meaning his car went from 108mph to a standstill in two seconds. He recovered and went on to race again.</p>

                <h2><i>Ayrton Senna</i></h2>
                <p>Ayrton Senna da Silva was born on March 21, 1960, into a wealthy Brazilian family where, with his brother and sister, he enjoyed a privileged upbringing. He never needed to race for money but his deep need for racing began with an infatuation for a miniature go-kart his father gave him when he was four years old. As a boy the highlights of Ayrton's life were Grand Prix mornings when he awoke trembling with anticipation at the prospect of watching his Formula One heroes in action on television. At 13 he raced a kart for the first time and immediately won. Eight years later he went single-seater racing in Britain, where in three years he won five championships, by which time he had divorced his young wife and forsaken a future in his father's businesses in favour of pursuing success in Formula One racing, where he made his debut with Toleman in 1984. At Monaco (a race he would win six times), his sensational second to Alain Prost's McLaren - in torrential rain - was confirmation of the phenomenal talent that would take the sport by storm.Beyond his driving genius Senna was one of the sport's most compelling personalities. Though slight in stature he possessed a powerful physical presence, and when he spoke, with his warm brown eyes sparkling and his voice quavering with intensity, his eloquence was spellbinding. Even the most jaded members of the Formula One fraternity were mesmerised by his passionate soliloquies and in his press conferences you could hear a pin drop as he spoke with such hypnotic effect. His command performances were captured by the media and the world at large became aware of Senna's magnetic appeal.Early in 1994 he spoke about his own future. "I want to live fully, very intensely. I would never want to live partially, suffering from illness or injury. If I ever happen to have an accident that eventually costs my life, I hope it happens in one instant."

                    And so it did, on May 1, 1994, in the San Marino Grand Prix, where his race-leading Williams inexplicably speared off the Imola track and hit the concrete wall at Tamburello corner. Millions saw it happen on television, the world mourned his passing and his state funeral in Sao Paulo was attended by many members of the shocked Formula One community. Among the several drivers escorting the coffin was Alain Prost. Among the sad mourners was Frank Williams, who said: "Ayrton was no ordinary person. He was actually a greater man out of the car than in it."</p>
